## Intro

This ecommerce storefront is an Amazon clone.

## Use

Users can register a new account, sign in and sign out.

Users can view the products available in the store.

Each product has a title, price, star rating, and product image on display.

Users can add products to cart.

Users can see how many items they have in the cart (displayed in the header).

Users can view the contents of their shopping Cart, and remove the items they no longer want.

## Stack

The frontend is built in React, and bootstrapped with create-react-app.  

Styling is plain CSS and Material UI.

Authentication is implemented with Firebase.

This is a single-page app, and all URL routing was implemented with React Router.

The currency in this app is displayed using react-currency-format.

The current version of the app is deployed on Firebase and can be viewed [HERE](https://ecommerce-webapp-4ef53.web.app/)

## Project status

This project is still being developed.

## Future direction

The next feature I am going to implement is a payment system with Stripe.
